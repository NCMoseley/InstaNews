# NYT Instanews
One-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via the New York Times API.

## Introduction
This page is optimized to run on most modern browsers. It is designed for 320px. 600px, and 1000px + screen resolutions. You can add items to the menu and adjust which topics are returned, if you desire more than the original 6. All of the articles returned are links that will take you away from the InstaTimes homepage and to the full article. 

With screen size less than 1000px, the article abstracts can be seen. Larger screen sizes than that have only the pictures shown until the mouse is hovered over. 

Many of the elements respond when the mouse is hovered over. It gives a lively dynamic feel to a relatively simple design.

## Build

I implemented Gulp to automatically compile .scss files into the final .css. This project was an opportunity to exercise a functional understanding of HTML, CSS and javascript/jquery, and use them all together in a single page. The addition of Selectric in the menu, along with the possibility of adding addition Categories to the list is my first chance to exhibit real software design. The NYT logo was a file taken from the web edited in Photoshop to fit the original design.
